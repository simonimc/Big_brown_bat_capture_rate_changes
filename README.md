The 'Simonis_et_al_2022_Oceologia_BigBrownBatCaptureRates.R' file contains all code for core analyses for creating Bayesian generalized linear models and must be run first. The 'Simonis_et_al_2022_Oceologia_BigBrownBatCaptureRates_Plots.rmd' file contains code for additional conditional effects analyses and figures created in R for changes to big brown capture rates with long-term Pd exposure across the eastern US. Information for where to obtain data and its full description is located within the R script.
